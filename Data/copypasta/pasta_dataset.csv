The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

This girl was finishing off a guy and she exclaimed oh yeah, give me that hot steamy load all over my face, and it was really a boner killer. Like, I did my fucking research. Semen in it of itself is 35-37°C or 98.6°F (normal bodily temperature). To claim that it is hot and steamy is simply not true.In converse, the temperature of something in order for it to steam must be upwards of 100°C or 212°F, which means that semen simply isn’t anywhere close to being hot nor steamy. But what does it mean for something to be hot? For some people it means that it’s uncomfortable to the touch since it burns you. But hot can also be comfortable too. Like sitting in front of a warm fire. To conclude my investigation I used practical experimentation to discover whether semen is in fact hot. Using autofellatio techniques that I had been previously been working on I was able to to unload on my own face. With that I can confirm that semen is not hot nor steamy. All that it provided was an uncomfortable taste - one such compared to gelatinous water with pulp. To the point, though, the semen discharged on my face was not hot and steamy.These lies spread by pornstars honestly baffle me and I feel ashamed to know that some people will live their entire lives believing that semen is hot and steamy.
